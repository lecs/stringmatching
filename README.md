# stringmatching
A collection of string matching related algorithms implemented in Clojure.

## Usage
The algorithms should be usable for offline string matching, hence one should
be able to use the created data structures similar to indeces for lookups.

Typically this involves a step that creates the 'index' data structure used
for lookups, and one where other strings are queried against this index.

### Implemented algorithms
